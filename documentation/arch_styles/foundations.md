# Foundations

Architecture styles, sometimes called architecture patterns, `define how components relate to each other and cover various architectural characteristics`. These style names are like shortcuts for experienced architects. For example, if an architect talks about a 'layered monolith,' it signals specific structural aspects, what works well (or not), common deployment models, data strategies, and more.

`An architecture style describes the structure and typical architectural characteristics`, both good and bad. `Architects should also understand the fundamental patterns often found within these styles`.

## Fundamental Patterns

`Over time, some basic patterns keep showing up in software architecture. These patterns help us organize code and deployments`. For instance, the idea of separating different concerns based on functionality, into layers is an age-old concept in software. It's been around for a long time and still appears in various forms, even in modern architecture.

### Unitary Architecture

In the early days of software, `the computer and software were one`. But as technology evolved, they separated to handle more complex tasks. Mainframes, for instance, began as single systems but later split data into separate systems. Today, `unitary architectures are rare, except in specific situations like embedded systems`. Most software systems grow in complexity, so we separate them into different parts to keep them running smoothly.
