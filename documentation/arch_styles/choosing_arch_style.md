# Choosing the Appropriate Architecture Style

`Determining the right architecture style can be a bit tricky`. With numerous choices available (and new ones popping up almost every day), `it's not that straightforward`. Choosing the appropriate architectural style `involves considering various factors within an organization and the specific software it's developing`. This decision-making process requires a careful `evaluation of trade-offs related to architectural characteristics, domain considerations, strategic goals, and several other variables`.

Even though the decision is deeply contextual, there are a few `pieces of general advice` that might come in handy as you navigate the landscape of architectural styles.

## Shifting “Fashion” in Architecture

`Understanding the dynamic landscape of architecture trends is crucial for architects`, regardless of where an organization currently stands in terms of architectural preferences. The ever-changing nature of preferred architecture styles is influenced by various factors:

??? note "Observations from the past"
    `New architecture styles often emerge from lessons learned and challenges faced in previous projects`. Architects draw from their past experiences to shape future systems, addressing deficiencies and optimizing design based on historical insights.
??? note "Changes in the ecosystem"
    The software development ecosystem is marked by `constant change, making predictions challenging`. Tools and technologies that were once unheard of can quickly become industry standards. For example, the rapid rise of `Kubernetes`, which few anticipated a few years ago, illustrates the unpredictable nature of ecosystem changes.
??? note "Introduction of New Capabilities"
     `When new capabilities arise, architecture may not merely replace one tool with another but rather shift to an entirely new paradigm`. Unexpected advancements, such as the introduction of containerization with Docker, have profound impacts on architects, tools, and engineering practices. `Architects must not only monitor new tools but also remain open to paradigmatic changes that might redefine their approach`.
??? note "Accelerated Rate of Change"
    The rate of change in the ecosystem continues to accelerate, driven by the emergence of new tools, engineering practices, and capabilities. `Architects operate in a state of constant flux, adapting to evolving trends and staying agile in response to ongoing transformations`.
??? note "Domain changes"
    `Changes in the business domain, driven by factors like business evolution or mergers, can influence the architectural choices made by developers`.
??? note "Technology changes"
    Organizations strive to keep up with technological advancements that offer obvious benefits. `Adopting technologies with clear advantages becomes a strategic move for staying competitive`.
??? note "External factors"
    External factors, such as changes in licensing costs, `may force architects and developers to reconsider their tooling choices and migrate to alternative options`.

## MICROSERVICE -> Choreography and Orchestration -> PARAGRAFO 2

Domain/architecture isomorphism is one key characteristic that architects should look for when assessing how appropriate an architecture style is for a particular problem. This term describes how the shape of an architecture maps to a particular architecture style.
