# Orchestration-Driven Service-Oriented Architecture

!!! danger
    This architecture style `represents an era-specific architectural style` influenced by external forces and organizational philosophies. Despite its logical foundation, `this architecture faced challenges that ultimately led to its downfall. It serves as a notable example of how a seemingly rational organizational idea can impede crucial aspects of the development process`.

## History and Philosophy

In the late 1990s, the Orchestration-Driven Service-Oriented Architecture emerged as enterprises were rapidly expanding, necessitating sophisticated IT solutions. During this era, `companies faced challenges related to limited and expensive computing resources, prompting the adoption of distributed architectures for their scalability benefits`. The prevailing constraints were driven by factors such as the cost of operating systems and complex licensing schemes for commercial database servers.

`As a result, architects were compelled to maximize reuse`. The dominant philosophy underlying this architecture was centered on `achieving extensive reuse in all forms, with far-reaching consequences`.

## Topology

The topology varied among implementations, but the overarching concept involved `establishing a taxonomy of services within the architecture, with each layer assigned specific responsibilities`.

This style of architecture is inherently `distributed`, and the precise delineation of boundaries varied depending on the organization's specific requirements and structure.
