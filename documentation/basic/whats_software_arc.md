# What is Software Architecture?

Software Architecture is a **dynamic and complex** field that **continues to evolve rapidly**. Recent years have witnessed advancements such as CI/CD, microservices, containerization, and cloud-based resources. These innovations bring new capabilities and trade-offs to consider.

In software development, understanding **trade-off analysis is crucial** for making informed decisions. This repository emphasizes analyzing trade-offs rather than passing judgments on technologies.

It is crucial to recognize that **architectures are shaped by their context**. Architectural decisions are often **ipnfluenced by the realities of the environment** they operate in. For instance, attempting to implement a microservices architecture in 2002 would have been impractical.

## Defining Software Architecture

Defining Software Architecture is challenging due to various interpretations. It may be seen as the blueprint or roadmap for a system. However, what aspects does an architect analyze when examining an architecture?

One definition in [Fundamentals of Software Architecture](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/fundamentals-of-software/9781492043447/) is illustrated on the image bellow. In this definition, software architecture consists of the **structure** of the system, combined with **architecture characteristics** the system must support, **architecture decisions**, and **design principles**.
