# Architectural Thinking

A software architecture goes beyond mere "thinking about the architecture." It encompasses various crucial aspects that architects need to consider, including:

- Architecture vs. Design: It is important to *distinguish between architecture and design* and effectively collaborate with development teams to align their efforts.

- Technical Breadth: It involves having a broad range of technical knowledge while *maintaining a certain level of depth*. This allows architects to see solutions and possibilities that others do not see.

- Analyzing Trade-Offs: Architects should *understand, analyze, and reconcile trade-offs between different solutions and technologies*.

- Understanding Business Drivers: Understand the importance of business drivers and how they translate to architectural concerns.
