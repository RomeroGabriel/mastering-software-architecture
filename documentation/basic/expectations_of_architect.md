# Expectations of an Architect

Defining the role of a software architect can be challenging, as it encompasses various aspects. However, it is essential to outline the **expectations and responsibilities** associated with the architect's role.

- Make architecture decisions
- Continually analyze the architecture
- Keep current with latest trends
- Ensure compliance with decisions
- Diverse exposure and experience
- Have business domain knowledge
- Possess interpersonal skills
- Understand and navigate politics

## Make architecture decisions

> An architect is expected to define the [architecture decisions](https://romerogabriel.github.io/mastering-software-architecture/basic/whats_software_arc/#architecture-decisions) and [design principles](https://romerogabriel.github.io/mastering-software-architecture/basic/whats_software_arc/#design-principles) used to guide technology decisions within the team, the department, or across the enterprise.

When it comes to making architecture decisions, **guidance is crucial**. Instead of strictly specifying technology choices, the role of an **architect  should guide rather than specify technology choices**.

For instance, rather than explicitly stating that React.js should be used for the frontend, **which is a technical decision**, the architect should **guide development teams towards choosing** a reactive-based framework for the frontend, offering options like Angular, React.js, Vue.js, and others. It is important to assess whether the **architecture decision is guiding teams** to make their own technical choices or if it imposes a specific technology upon them, which may hinder their decision-making process.

While the role of an architect primarily focuses on guiding rather than specifying technology choices, there are situations where specific technology decisions become necessary to **preserve a particular architectural characteristics** like scalability, performance, or availability. Even though these decisions involve choosing a particular technology, they still fall within the realm of architectural decisions.

However, it's important to acknowledge that finding the right decision in such cases can be challenging. The topic of making architecture decisions will be further explored and discussed in subsequent sections.

## Continually analyze the architecture

> An architect is expected to continually analyze the architecture and current technology environment and then recommend solutions for improvement.

This responsibility refers to **architecture vitality**, analyzing how well the **architecture can sustain itself over time**. It is not a common concern, as many architectures e**ncounter structural decay** when developers introduce code or design changes that affect the required architectural characteristics.

Additionally, **testing and release environments often tend to be overlooked** in this context. If the testing and release processes consume excessive time, it becomes challenging to achieve overall agility in the architecture.

## Keep current with latest trends

> An architect is expected to keep current with the latest technology and industry trends.

Keeping up with the latest trends is crucial for staying relevant in the field of architecture. The **decisions made by an architect often have long-lasting effects and can be challenging to modify later on**. By actively staying informed about and embracing key trends, architects can **better prepare for the future and make well-informed decisions** that align with industry advancements. This proactive approach ensures that architectural decisions are forward-thinking and capable of meeting evolving needs and challenges.

## Ensure compliance with decisions

> An architect is expected to ensure compliance with architecture decisions and design principles.

## Diverse exposure and experience

> An architect is expected to have exposure to multiple and diverse technologies, frameworks, platforms, and environments.

## Have business domain knowledge

> An architect is expected to have a certain level of business domain expertise.

## Possess interpersonal skills

> An architect is expected to possess exceptional interpersonal skills, including teamwork, facilitation, and leadership.

## Understand and navigate politicstest

> An architect is expected to understand the political climate of the enterprise and be able to navigate the politics.
