# Architecture Decisions

Architects play a pivotal role in making crucial architecture decisions that shape the application or system. `While these decisions primarily influence the structure of the application or system, they might also extend to technology choices, especially when they impact essential architectural characteristics`. Regardless of the context, a good architecture decision serves as a guiding force for development teams, helping them in making in making the right technical choices. The process involves `gathering relevant information, providing clear justifications, documenting decisions, and ensuring effective communication with the pertinent stakeholders`.

## Architecture Decision Anti-Patterns

Not surprisingly, `several pitfalls emerge when architects make decisions`. Three major architecture anti-patterns that often unfold during decision-making are the `Covering Your Assets` anti-pattern, the `Groundhog Day` anti-pattern, and the `Email-Driven Architecture` anti-pattern. These typically follow a progression: `overcoming the first leads to the second, and overcoming the second leads to the third`. Navigating architecture decisions successfully requires architects to address each of these anti-patterns.

!!! note "1. Covering Your Assets Anti-Pattern"
    `This occurs when architects avoid or delay decisions due to the fear of making the wrong choice`. To overcome this anti-pattern, `architects can either wait until the last responsible moment to decide or collaborate continually with development teams to ensure the decision aligns with implementation realities`.

    `Waiting until the last responsible moment means gathering enough information to justify and validate the decision without causing delays or succumbing to analysis paralysis`. Collaborating with development teams is crucial because architects can't possibly anticipate every detail about a technology. `Close collaboration enables swift adjustments to the decision if issues arise`.

    For instance, if an architect decides to cache product-related reference data in all service instances using a read-only replicated cache, collaboration with development teams may reveal scalability issues that prompt a revision of the decision.

!!! note "2. Groundhog Day Anti-Pattern"
    Once architects overcome the first anti-pattern, they may encounter the Groundhog Day anti-pattern. `This unfolds when people repeatedly discuss a decision without a clear understanding of why it was made`.

    The Groundhog Day anti-pattern `arises when architects fail to provide a comprehensive justification for their decisions`. When justifying architecture decisions, `it's crucial to offer both technical and business justifications`.
    
    For instance, a decision to break apart a monolithic application into separate services `should not only highlight technical benefits but also articulate the business value, such as faster delivery of new functionality or cost reduction`. Providing business value is a litmus test for determining the validity of an architecture decision. If a decision lacks business value, it might not be a sound one and should be reconsidered.

!!! note "3. Email-Driven Architecture Anti-Pattern"
    Once architects make decisions and fully justify them, a third architecture anti-pattern emerges: Email-Driven Architecture. `This anti-pattern occurs when people are unaware of an architecture decision, leading to implementation challenges`.

    `Effectively communicating architecture decisions is crucial to avoid the Email-Driven Architecture anti-pattern`. Rather than including the decision in the body of an email, `architects should provide a link to a single system of record for the decision, whether it's a wiki page or a document`. This ensures a centralized and accessible repository for the decision and its details. Moreover, `notifying only relevant stakeholders further enhances communication effectiveness, preventing information overload`.

By addressing these anti-patterns, architects can enhance the decision-making process, fostering clarity, collaboration, and successful implementation.
