# Modularity

> 95% of the words [about software architecture] are spent extolling the benefits of “modularity” and that little, if anything, is said about how to achieve it.

Modularity is a `fundamental organizing principle` in software architecture. If an architect neglects how the components of a system interconnect, it can lead to numerous problems.

Although the concept of modularity is widely recognized in software architecture, it can be elusive to precisely define. These modules serve as a `means of encapsulating functionality, promoting code organization, and enhancing maintainability`.

Maintaining good modularity embodies an `implicit architectural characteristic`: most projects may not explicitly demand the architect to ensure it, but **sustainable code bases necessitate order and consistency in modular distinction and communication**. A well-organized system with clear boundaries between modules fosters code reusability, ease of maintenance, and scalability, contributing to the long-term success of the project.

## Definition

Modularity refers to the `logical grouping of related code`, whether it's classes in an object-oriented language or functions in a structured or functional language. Developers commonly employ modules to organize and group related code together.

For architects, understanding how developers package code is crucial, as it significantly impacts the architecture. `Tight coupling between packages can make it challenging to reuse one of them for related tasks`.
