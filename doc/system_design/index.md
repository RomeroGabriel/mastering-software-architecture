# System Design

`System design is a meticulous process encompassing the definition of architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data to fulfill specific requirements`. `This entails the translation of user needs into detailed blueprints, providing guidance for the implementation phase`. The goal is to create a well-organized and efficient structure that meets the intended purpose. Factors such as scalability, maintainability, and performance are carefully considered throughout this design journey.

## Goal

The objectives of system design include `practicality`, `accuracy`, `completeness`, `efficiency`, `reliability`, `optimization`, and `scalability`.

!!! note "Practicality"
    Practicality ensures the system targets the right audience.

!!! note "Accuracy"
    Accuracy means the system should fulfill all `functional and non-functional requirements`.

!!! note "Completeness"
    Completeness implies the system should meet all user requirements.

!!! note "Efficiency"
    Efficiency requires the system design not to overuse resources or underuse them.

!!! note "Reliability"
    Reliability ensures the system operates in a failure-free environment for a certain period.

!!! note "Optimization"
    Optimization involves optimizing time and space for individual components to work in the system efficiently.

!!! note "Scalability"
    Scalability ensures the system is adaptable with time as per different user needs.
