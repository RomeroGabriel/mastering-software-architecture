# Requirements

Requirements in system design refer to the `specifications that define what the system should do and how it should behave`. There are two main types of requirements: functional and non-functional. Both functional and non-functional requirements are `vital for a successful` system design. They guide the development process, helping to `ensure that the system meets the needs of its users and achieves its intended purpose`.

## Functional Requirements

Functional requirements `specify what a system must do`. `They are essentially the behaviors of the system and define the system's functionality`. They are usually `stated in terms of user actions or events` that the system should respond to.

!!! example
    The system should allow users to create accounts and log in using credentials like email and password or through social media integration.

## Non-Functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements `define how the system should perform`. They are not related to the system's functionality but rather `define the system's behavior`. They are crucial for ensuring the system's usability, reliability, and efficiency, often influencing the overall user experience.

!!! example
    1. Performance (e.g., the system should load within 3 seconds when the number of simultaneous users exceeds 10,000)
    1. Security (e.g., emails should be sent with a latency of no greater than 12 hours from such an activity)
    1. Usability (e.g., the system should be user-friendly and meet users' needs).
