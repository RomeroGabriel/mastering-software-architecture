# Architecture Styles

`An architecture style refers to the overall structure of a software system, including how the user interface, backend code, and data storage are organized`. It encompasses decisions like whether to use a [monolithic approach with all components together or a distributed approach with separate services](../arch_characteristics/scope.md#choosing-between-monolithic-x-distributed-architectures).

On the other hand, `architecture patterns are more detailed design structures that offer solutions within a specific architecture style`. These patterns address specific concerns, such as achieving scalability or optimizing performance for certain operations or services. They serve as practical templates for solving particular problems within the chosen architecture style.

For new architects, `grasping different architecture styles is essential, as they form the foundation for making effective design decisions`. Each architecture style comes with its own set of trade-offs, which help architects choose the most suitable approach for a given business problem.
